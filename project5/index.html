      <p>
      I used images I took a while ago for this project. In the first part, I made a clicking tool to select points on an image and record them to a .json file. I started off by selecting the corners of a table for image rectification.

      <p>
        The second part of this project is recovering homographies between the set of correspondences. The strategy I used for writing code for this part was very similar to project 3 with the affine transformation and inverse warping, but I modified it to find a homography matrix.

     <div class="row">
      <h6 class="smallheader">Part 3: Image Rectification</h6>
      <p>
      In this part I used the homography matrix between the table points and a front-parallel square to rectify the original image. This was done by applying the homography to perform the transformation, and then inverse warping to perform interpolation for the colors.

        <h6 class="smallheader">Part 4: Image Mosaics</h6>
        <p>
        In this part I created image mosaics by finding correspondences between images and then warping one image into the other. I took all of these images around January of this year, and so unfortunately the exposures as well as some of the subject locations (water, plants) differed between both shots. I attempted to blend together the seams between the images with a 2-layer Laplacian pyramid.

        <h6 class="smallheader">Coolest thing I learned</h6>
        <p>
        The overall premise of the project was pretty cool - while I was taking these photos with my phone, I was pretty bummed about not being able to capture a certain composition I wanted in a frame. I didn't know that it was possible to mathematically warp them together, and all you needed to do was define some correspondences. I think this is a super cool technique that I might use on photos in the future, and in the future I'll also try maintaining the same exposure when taking photos for this purpose.
